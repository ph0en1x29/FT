## Overview

This specification covers the workflow implementation for ACWER Industrial Equipment, a forklift rental company in Malaysia. The system manages service jobs for ~2,000 forklifts with ~60 daily jobs across branches in Johor and Penang.

### Key Principles
- **Auditability:** Every action must be traceable
- **Operational realism:** Edge cases handled gracefully
- **Mobile-first:** Technicians work on-site with phones
- **Admin control:** Spare parts and reassignments require Admin approval

---

## Entities & Roles

### Roles

|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Create/assign jobs, approve requests, select spare parts, amend Items Used, download photos, monitor hourmeter, handle reassignments, track KPI |
| **Supervisor** | View all jobs, limited approvals (TBD) |
| **Lead Technician** | Full job permissions: hourmeter input, spare parts requests, job completion, customer signature |
| **Assistant Technician** | Limited: start/end times, photos only. No hourmeter, no spare parts, no signature |

---

## Helper Technician

### Implementation

Helper is **not a new role**. It's an `assignment_type` within `JobAssignment`.

```typescript
interface JobAssignment {
  job_id: string;
  technician_id: string;
  assignment_type: 'lead' | 'assistant';
  assigned_at: timestamp;
  started_at?: timestamp;
  ended_at?: timestamp;
}
```

### Permissions Matrix

| Action | Lead | Assistant |
|--------|------|-----------|
| View job details | ✅ Full | ✅ Limited (machine, location, issue) |
| Upload start photo | ✅ | ✅ |
| Upload end photo | ✅ | ✅ |
| Input hourmeter | ✅ | ❌ |
| Request spare parts | ✅ | ❌ |
| Add Items Used | ✅ | ❌ |
| Complete job | ✅ | ❌ |
| Capture signature | ✅ | ❌ |
| View job history/notes | ✅ | ❌ |

### Constraints

- Maximum **1 assistant** per job at any time
- Same person can be lead on Job A, assistant on Job B
- Assistant can be **replaced** (sequential, not simultaneous)
- All assistant photos tagged with `is_helper_photo = true`


---

## In-Job Request System

Three request types during active job:

### 1. Assistance Request

**Flow:**
1. Lead Technician → clicks "Request Assistance"
2. Admin receives notification
3. Admin assigns Assistant Technician
4. Assistant sees job in their app (limited view)
5. Assistant logs start/end times, uploads photos
6. No Items Used, no signature from assistant

### 2. Spare Part Request

**Flow:**
1. Lead Technician → clicks "Request Spare Part"
2. Enters: text description + optional photo of faulty component
3. Can request multiple parts at once
4. Admin receives notification
5. Admin reviews, selects part from inventory, sets quantity
6. Approves or rejects with reason
7. Approved parts appear in Lead Technician's Items Used list
8. Admin can amend Items Used post-job before finalizing

### 3. Skillful Technician Request

**Flow:**
1. Lead Technician → clicks "Request Skillful Technician"
2. Enters reason (skill/expertise issue)
3. Admin reviews
4. Admin reassigns job to new technician
5. Triggers reassignment flow (see below)

---

## Job Reassignment

### Triggers
- Skillful Technician Request (skill issue)
- Technician unavailable (sick, emergency)
- Admin decision

### Flow

1. **Current tech's job marked:** `INCOMPLETE_REASSIGNED`
2. **Partial work recorded:**
   - `reassignment_reason`
   - `partial_work_notes` (tasks completed)
   - `partial_work_time_minutes` (hours spent)
3. **Items Used handling:**
   - Admin reviews each item
   - Decision per item: `cancelled` or `transferred`
   - Only `transferred` items appear for new tech
4. **New tech assigned:**
   - Job appears as new assignment
   - All history visible (notes, photos, hourmeter)
   - Only new tech updates Items Used going forward
5. **KPI impact:**
   - Original tech: +1 incomplete
   - New tech: +1 completed (when finished)

### Multi-Reassignment (A → B → C)

Same rules apply at each step:
- Tech A: incomplete
- Tech B: incomplete  
- Tech C: completed (when finished)

Each reassignment creates audit record with reason and partial work.

---

## Multi-Day Jobs & Escalation

### CutOffTime

When technician cannot complete same day:
1. Submits reason/details
2. Job marked `INCOMPLETE_TO_BE_CONTINUED`
3. `cutoff_time` recorded
4. Job stays with same technician
5. All data persists (notes, photos, hourmeter)

### Escalation Rules

| Day Type | Escalation | Work Status | Days Counter |
|----------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| Monday-Friday | 8:00 AM next business day | Standard Job | Counts |
| Saturday (Admin-arranged OT) | Disabled | Overtime Job | Paused |
| Sunday | No work expected | — | Paused |

### Escalation Logic

```typescript
function calculateEscalationTime(jobAssignedAt: Date, isOvertime: boolean): Date | null {
  if (isOvertime) return null; // No escalation for OT jobs
  
  const nextBusinessDay = getNextBusinessDay(jobAssignedAt);
  return setTime(nextBusinessDay, 8, 0, 0); // 8:00 AM
}

function getNextBusinessDay(date: Date): Date {
  let next = addDays(date, 1);
  while (isWeekend(next)) {
    next = addDays(next, 1);
  }
  return next;
}
```

### Escalation Management (Admin Dashboard)

When jobs escalate, they appear on Admin Dashboard for resolution:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `escalation_triggered_at` | When escalation fired (8 AM next business day) |
| `escalation_acknowledged_at` | When Admin took ownership |
| `escalation_acknowledged_by` | Which Admin acknowledged |
| `escalation_notes` | Notes about delay/action taken |

**Admin Workflow:**
1. See escalated jobs on Dashboard (sorted: unacknowledged first)
2. **Acknowledge** - Take ownership (stops repeated alerts to others)
3. **Add notes** - Document reason for delay (e.g., "Waiting for parts")
4. **Take action:**
   - Reassign to different technician
   - Mark as overtime (disable escalation)
   - Contact customer/technician (phone numbers visible)
5. Job auto-resolves when status changes to Completed

**Visual States:**
- 🔴 **New** (unacknowledged): Red, prominent
- ⚪ **Acknowledged**: Gray, still visible until resolved
- ✅ **Resolved**: Hidden (job completed)

---

## Customer Signature Flow

### Standard Flow (On-Site Signature)

1. Lead Technician completes work
2. Uploads end photo
3. Captures customer signature on device
4. Enters customer name/designation
5. Job → `COMPLETED`

### Deferred Acknowledgement Flow

**Trigger:** Customer not available or refuses to sign

1. Technician selects "Customer Not Signed Onsite"
2. **Required inputs:**
   - Reason (dropdown + text)
   - Evidence photos (minimum 1)
   - Hourmeter reading
3. Job → `COMPLETED_AWAITING_ACKNOWLEDGEMENT`
4. **System auto-sends** digital service report to customer:
   - Email
   - Customer portal
   - SMS (if configured)
5. **Customer has 3-5 working days** to:
   - Sign digitally
   - Acknowledge without signature
   - Raise dispute
6. **No response:** Job auto-converts to `COMPLETED`, Admin notified
7. **Dispute:** Job → `DISPUTED`, Admin handles manually

---

## Hourmeter & Service Prediction

### Input Rules

- **Who:** Lead Technician only
- **When:** During job (required for completion)
- **Validation:** Must be ≥ last recorded reading for that forklift

### Service Intervals by Forklift Type

| Type | Interval | Trigger |
|------|----------|---------|
| Electric | 3 months | Calendar (from delivery date) |
| Diesel | 500 hours | Hourmeter |
| LPG | 350 hours | Hourmeter |

### Prediction Logic

```typescript
function predictNextService(forklift: Forklift): ServicePrediction {
  if (forklift.type === 'electric') {
    const lastService = forklift.last_service_date || forklift.delivery_date;
    const nextDue = addMonths(lastService, 3);
    return {
      forklift_id: forklift.id,
      next_service_due: nextDue,
      days_until_service: differenceInDays(nextDue, new Date()),
      trigger_type: 'calendar'
    };
  } else {
    const interval = forklift.type === 'diesel' ? 500 : 350;
    const lastServiceHours = forklift.last_service_hourmeter || 0;
    const currentHours = forklift.current_hourmeter;
    const hoursRemaining = (lastServiceHours + interval) - currentHours;
    
    return {
      forklift_id: forklift.id,
      hours_until_service: hoursRemaining,
      trigger_type: 'hourmeter'
    };
  }
}
```

## KPI Tracking

### Metrics per Technician

| Metric | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| Jobs Completed | Count where final status = COMPLETED and tech was last assignee |
| Jobs Incomplete | Count where job was reassigned away from tech |
| Jobs Reassigned To | Count where tech received already-started job |
| Completion Rate | Completed / (Completed + Incomplete) |

### Visibility

| Role | Can See |
|------|---------|
| Admin | All technicians, all metrics |
| Supervisor | Their branch technicians |
| Technician | Own metrics only |

---
