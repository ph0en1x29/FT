## [2026-02-04] - Hourmeter Service Prediction System

### New Feature: Engine Hour-Based Service Prediction

Predicts next service date for Diesel, LPG, and Petrol forklifts based on hourmeter usage patterns.

#### How It Works
1. **Collects Data:** Last service hourmeter, current hourmeter, service interval
2. **Calculates Average Usage:** Hours used ÷ days since last reading = avg hrs/day
3. **Predicts Service Date:** Hours until service ÷ avg hrs/day = days remaining
4. **Auto-Resets:** After service completion, cycle restarts automatically
5. **Updates Dynamically:** Every new reading recalculates the prediction

#### Database Changes
- `forklifts` table: Added `last_service_hourmeter`, `service_interval_hours` columns
- New `hourmeter_readings` table: Tracks all hourmeter readings with timestamps
- `calculate_predicted_service_date()` function: Server-side prediction calculation
- `complete_forklift_service()` function: Resets tracking after service
- `v_forklift_service_predictions` view: Dashboard-ready predictions with urgency

#### New Files
- `services/hourmeterService.ts` — Extended with service prediction functions
- `components/hourmeter/HourmeterReadingForm.tsx` — Record hourmeter readings
- `components/hourmeter/ServicePredictionCard.tsx` — Display prediction info
- `components/hourmeter/ServicePredictionDashboard.tsx` — Dashboard widget
- `database/migrations/20260204_hourmeter_service_prediction.sql` — Full migration

#### Types Added
- `HourmeterReading` — Individual reading record
- `ServicePrediction` — Calculation result
- `ForkliftWithPrediction` — Forklift with prediction data
- `ServicePredictionDashboard` — Dashboard widget data
- `ServiceUrgency` — Urgency levels (overdue, due_soon, upcoming, ok)

#### Service Functions
- `recordHourmeterReading()` — Log a new reading
- `getHourmeterReadings()` — Fetch reading history
- `getServicePrediction()` — Get prediction for one forklift
- `getForkliftServicePredictions()` — Get all predictions
- `getServicePredictionDashboard()` — Dashboard data grouped by urgency
- `completeForkliftService()` — Reset after service
- `updateServiceInterval()` — Change service interval

#### Helpers
- `requiresHourmeterTracking()` — Check if forklift type needs tracking
- `formatDaysRemaining()` — Human-readable countdown
- `getUrgencyColor()` — CSS classes for urgency display

### Migration Required
Run `20260204_hourmeter_service_prediction.sql` on Supabase to enable the feature.

## [2026-02-03] - Security Fixes (Codex Review)

### Critical Fixes

#### 1. Race Condition in Spare Parts Approval — FULLY FIXED
- **Issue:** Separate stock check and update allowed overselling
- **Fix (v1):** Atomic update with WHERE clause
- **Fix (v2):** New SQL function `reserve_part_stock()` with row-level locking
- **Files:** `services/jobRequestService.ts`, `supabase/migrations/20260203_atomic_stock_reserve.sql`
- **Rollback:** `rollback_part_stock()` function for failure recovery

#### 2. Assistance Approval Bug  
- **Issue:** Request marked approved before helper assignment, causing false positives
- **Fix:** Assign helper FIRST, only mark approved if successful
- **File:** `services/jobRequestService.ts`

#### 3. Telegram Token Security
- **Issue:** Base64 JSON token allowed potential forgery
- **Fix:** Added expiry timestamp (5 min), nonce for replay protection
- **File:** `components/TelegramConnect.tsx`
- **Note:** Server-side validation required in webhook

### Security Improvements

#### Dev Mode Protection
- **Issue:** Hardcoded `dev@test.com` could be exploited
- **Fix:** Removed hardcoded email, dev mode only works in dev environment
- **File:** `hooks/useDevMode.ts`

#### Signed URLs for HR Documents
- **Issue:** HR documents (permits, licenses, profile photos) used public URLs
- **Fix:** Implemented signed URLs with 1-hour expiry
- **Files:** `permitService.ts`, `licenseService.ts`, `hrService.ts`, `leaveService.ts`
- **New methods:** `getPermitDocumentUrl()`, `getLicenseImageUrl()`, `getProfilePhotoUrl()`, `getLeaveDocumentUrl()`

#### Gemini API Key Documentation
- Added security notes about client-side key exposure
- Documented mitigations and production recommendations
- **File:** `services/geminiService.ts`

### Database Changes
- `reserve_part_stock(UUID, INTEGER)` — Atomic stock reservation with row lock
- `rollback_part_stock(UUID, INTEGER)` — Undo stock reservation

## [2026-02-02] - Customer Feedback Bug Fixes

### Bug Fixes
- **Checklist validation** — Fixed "invalid input syntax for type boolean: 'ok'" error
  - Root cause: Trigger tried to cast string 'ok' to boolean
  - Fix: Now handles both old (true/false) and new ('ok'/'not_ok') formats
  
- **Job completion validation** — Fixed "Job was never started (started_at is null)" error
  - Root cause: Status dropdown path didn't sync `started_at` to service record
  - Fix: Now checks `jobs.started_at`, `repair_start_time`, and `arrival_time` as fallbacks
  - Added trigger to auto-sync job timestamps to service records

### Database Changes
- `validate_job_checklist()` — Handles string checklist states
- `validate_job_completion_requirements()` — Checks multiple timestamp sources
- `sync_job_started_to_service_record()` — New trigger for timestamp sync
- Backfill migration for existing service records

### Code Changes
- `jobService.ts` — `updateJobStatus` now syncs `started_at` to service records

### Tests Added
- `tests/customer-feedback-fixes.spec.ts` — Validates both fixes

### New: Error Tracking ("Desire Paths")
- `user_action_errors` table — Tracks failed user actions
- `errorTrackingService.ts` — Service to log and analyze errors
- Auto-tracking integrated into `toastService.ts`
- Helps identify what users try to do that fails → build those features

### Security: Hide Pricing from Technicians
- **Inventory Page** — Cost and Price columns hidden for technicians
- **Inventory Stats** — Inventory Value card hidden for technicians
- Uses existing `canViewPricing` permission from `ROLE_PERMISSIONS`
- Admins, Supervisors, Accountants still see all pricing

### Pre-Job Parts Allocation
- **Admins** can now add parts to jobs at ANY stage (New, Assigned, In Progress, Awaiting)
- **Supervisors** can add parts from Assigned onwards
- **Accountants** can only add at Awaiting Finalization (invoice adjustments)
- UI shows "(Pre-allocation)" label when adding parts to New/Assigned jobs
- Simplified and clarified `canAddParts` logic

### Request Edit Capability
- **Technicians** can now edit their own pending requests
- Edit button appears next to "Pending" requests they created
- Only works while request status is 'pending' (before admin review)
- Can modify: request type, description, photo URL
- Modal reused from create flow with edit mode support
- Service validates ownership + pending status before allowing update

### Dashboard Prototypes (All Roles)
- **Admin V5** — Option C style: full-width sections, top 5 items, "View all" links
- **Admin V6** — Full-featured prototype with:
  - Smart context-aware greeting ("5 jobs today, 2 techs available • ⚠️ 1 escalation")
  - Quick Actions row (Assign Jobs, Generate Invoices, Send Reminders)
  - 6 KPI cards including SLA metrics (On-Time %, Avg Response Time)
  - Today's Schedule timeline with visual job status
  - Notification filters (All/Jobs/Requests/System)
  - Outstanding Invoices card
  - Today's Progress bar
  - Team Status with grouped chips
- **Supervisor V5** — Team-focused with layout options (C: Top 5, D: Grouped)
- Toggle V4/V5/V6 via buttons in header (`dev@test.com` only)

### Performance: Egress Optimization
- Added `getUsersLightweight` (7 cols vs 30+)
- Dashboard now uses lightweight queries
- `getEmployees` no longer fetches nested data by default
- Estimated 70-80% reduction in egress for list views

### Checklist Improvements
- **"Check All" button** — Marks all 48 checklist items as OK with one click
- **Auto-X on untick** — Click OK on already-checked item to mark as needs attention
- **Workflow:** Check All → Untick exceptions → Save

### Bug Fixes
- **Complete button** — Now shows warning modal for missing mandatory checklist items
- **Photo upload** — Fixed black screen / slowness with image compression (1920px max, 85% quality)
