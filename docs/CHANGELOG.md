## [2026-04-07] — Job# Column Overflow + ConfirmationStatusCard Mobile Overflow

### Fixes

**JobBoard list: job# column no longer overflows into adjacent cells**
- Live DB query confirmed all 29 job_numbers are 17 characters long (`JOB-YYYYMMDD-NNNN` format like `JOB-20260407-0001`). Earlier Sonnet sizing iterations from 2026-04-06 (130 → 170 → 130 → 150) were all based on a wrong assumption about format length and never tested against the production format. The current 150px column with `whitespace-nowrap` (added in a previous "never clip the last digit" fix) wasn't wide enough — the text bled past its container into neighbouring columns.
- Bumped the desktop Star+Job# column to `w-[180px]` (`pages/JobBoard/components/JobListRow.tsx:275`), which fits 17 chars + `#` prefix in mono `text-sm` (~130px text + 24px star + 6px gap) with margin. Added `overflow-hidden` as a belt-and-suspenders guard so any future longer format clips rather than bleeds. The mobile (article) layout is unchanged — it uses flex-wrap, not fixed widths.
- File: `pages/JobBoard/components/JobListRow.tsx`

**ConfirmationStatusCard rows no longer burst out of the card on mobile**
- Both rows (Parts Confirmation and Job Confirmation) used `flex items-center justify-between` with the right side marked `shrink-0`. When the confirmer name is long (e.g., "BEE PHENG SIANG") + the date span + the CheckCircle icon, the right side's intrinsic width exceeded the container's available width on mobile (~310px usable after padding). With `shrink-0` the right side refused to compress and visually overflowed the rounded card.
- Changed both row containers to `flex flex-col sm:flex-row sm:items-center sm:justify-between gap-2`. On screens < `sm` (640px) the rows now stack vertically — left header on top, status/name/date on a wrapped row below. On `sm+` they remain side-by-side. Removed `shrink-0` from the right side and added `flex-wrap`, `min-w-0`, and `sm:justify-end` so the right side can wrap if still tight, and right-aligns when on the same row.

## [2026-04-07] — One-Off Purge: Hard-Deleted All Jobs Before 2026-04-06 (Executed)

### Chores

**Hard-deleted 93 jobs created before 2026-04-06 via `scripts/2026-04-07_purge_old_jobs.sql`**
- Client requested removing all jobs older than 2026-04-06 to clean up the working set after the demo. **Executed live at 2026-04-07 18:35** — destructive and not reversible from this side. Recovery from here requires Supabase point-in-time-recovery.
- Phase 0 schema introspection mapped all 30 foreign keys referencing the `jobs` table: 16 CASCADE (handled automatically), 1 SET NULL, 13 NO ACTION. Of the 13 NO ACTION FKs, 10 columns are nullable (dependent records preserved by setting their FK to NULL) and 3 are NOT NULL (`customer_acknowledgements`, `service_upgrade_logs`, `van_stock_usage` — hard-deleted).
- Scope: **ALL 93 jobs** in the date range 2026-03-05 → 2026-04-04, **including 55 active jobs** (42 Assigned + 13 In Progress). Per Jay's explicit confirmation.
- The script ran inside a single `BEGIN ... COMMIT` transaction with 6 numbered phases: snapshot in-scope IDs to a temp table → null out nullable FK references → hard-delete NOT NULL FK dependents → delete notifications → `DELETE FROM jobs` (CASCADE handles ~16 child tables) → sanity checks. A dry-run via `BEGIN ... ROLLBACK` was performed beforehand and the row counts matched exactly when the real run executed.
- **Final execution counts**:

  | Step | Rows |
  |---|---|
  | Jobs deleted | **93** |
  | `notifications` deleted | 419 |
  | `hourmeter_history.job_id` set NULL | 51 |
  | `inventory_movements.job_id` set NULL | 23 |
  | `van_stock_usage` hard-deleted | 2 |
  | `customer_acknowledgements` hard-deleted | 0 |
  | `service_upgrade_logs` hard-deleted | 0 |
  | All other nullable FK updates | 0 |
  | CASCADE child tables (job_parts, job_media, job_invoices, job_assignments, job_audit_log, etc.) | handled automatically |

- **Post-execution sanity checks**: 0 jobs older than 2026-04-06 remain (PASS); 29 total jobs left in the table; 10 pre-existing orphan notifications noted (these reference jobs already deleted in a prior cleanup, not introduced by this purge).

## [2026-04-07] — 15-Minute No-Reply Re-Alert for Job Assignments

### Features

**Admins are now re-alerted every 15 minutes when a technician doesn't respond to an assignment**
- Client requested: *"If job is not replied by 15 mins, re-send alert to admin to either re-assign or check with technician."*
- Phase 0 live DB introspection uncovered three sub-bugs that had to be fixed together: (a) the `technician_response_deadline` column the TS type already declared had never actually been added to the live `jobs` table, (b) `assignJob()` never set the deadline (would have failed anyway), so the frontend countdown timer at `pages/JobDetail/utils.ts:21` always returned null, and (c) `checkExpiredJobResponses()` existed in `services/jobAssignmentCrudService.ts` but was never invoked from anywhere — no scheduler.
- The fix is **fully server-side**, zero JS/TS changes. Migration `supabase/migrations/20260407_assignment_response_alerts.sql`:
  - Adds three columns: `technician_response_deadline` (the timer the frontend already reads), `last_response_alert_at` (15-min throttle), and `response_alert_count` (cap at 4 alerts = 1 hour total nagging window).
  - Backfills `technician_response_deadline = assigned_at + 15 minutes` for the 120 currently-assigned jobs.
  - Backfills `last_response_alert_at = NOW()` for the 50 currently-stale assignments so the new system doesn't burst-fire ~50 historical notifications on the very first cron tick after deployment. They re-alert at the normal 15-minute cadence from there.
  - Adds trigger `trg_set_response_deadline` (BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OF assigned_at) that auto-populates `technician_response_deadline` and resets the alert tracker whenever a job is freshly assigned. Because this lives in the trigger, `assignJob()` and any other path that writes `assigned_at` gets the deadline for free — that's why no service code change is needed.
  - Adds new SECURITY DEFINER function `escalate_assignment_response()` that finds assigned jobs past their deadline (with a 24-hour lookback cap, so historical stale data doesn't pollute the alert stream), increments the count, updates the last-alerted timestamp, and inserts one notification per active admin/admin_service/supervisor. The notification title includes the iteration counter (e.g., *"(2/4)"*) and the final alert switches priority to `urgent` with the message *"This is the final automatic reminder — please reassign or contact the technician."*
  - Amends the existing `run_escalation_checks()` (called every 5 minutes by the existing `escalation-checks` pg_cron job) to also call the new worker. **No new cron job** — the existing 5-min schedule picks it up automatically.
- The frontend countdown timer in `JobHeader.tsx:153` starts working automatically as soon as a job has a non-null deadline (any new assignment or any of the 120 backfilled rows).
- Migration applied directly to the live DB and verified: all 3 columns present, 120 deadlines backfilled, 50 stale jobs suppressed, dry-run of the new function returned 0 alerts (correct — all stale jobs suppressed for 15 minutes, then they ramp up at the normal cadence).
- Files: `supabase/migrations/20260407_assignment_response_alerts.sql`

## [2026-04-07] — Technician Job Rejection Unblocked + On-Site Photo Proof

### Fixes

**Technician rejection no longer blocked by status-transition trigger**
- Client reported: *"Failed to reject job, only admin or supervisor can move jobs backward."*
- Root cause confirmed via live DB introspection: the `validate_job_status_transition` trigger function in the live `public` schema rejected ALL backward status transitions for non-admin/non-supervisor users. The technician rejection flow legitimately moves a job from `Assigned` back to `New` (it's the only way to release the assignment back to dispatch), so it was permanently blocked. The function lived in `database/historical/` locally — meaning the migration had been deployed, then the file was archived without dropping the trigger.
- Fix applied via `supabase/migrations/20260407_fix_tech_rejection.sql`: `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION validate_job_status_transition` adds one tightly-scoped whitelist branch — a technician can backward-transition their OWN currently-assigned job from `Assigned` to `New` *only when* `NEW.technician_rejected_at IS NOT NULL` and `NEW.assigned_technician_id IS NULL`. Every other backward-transition guard remains exactly as before. Migration applied directly to the live DB inside a transaction and verified post-apply.

### Features

**Rejection now requires reason + on-site photo with GPS**
- Per client feedback, rejecting a job is no longer a free action — the technician must (a) provide a written reason and (b) capture an on-site photo with GPS coordinates so admins can verify the rejection was made on-site (e.g., weather condition, blocked access, customer not present).
- The same migration adds a nullable `jobs.technician_rejection_photo_id` UUID column with a foreign key to `job_media(media_id) ON DELETE SET NULL`. The rejection photo is uploaded via a new standalone helper at `services/rejectionPhotoUpload.ts` which captures GPS in parallel with image compression, uploads to the `job-photos` storage bucket, and inserts a `job_media` row with `category='rejection_proof'`. The new `media_id` is then written to `jobs.technician_rejection_photo_id` so the rejection proof is permanently linked to the job.
- GPS is **required**, not best-effort. If the technician denies geolocation permission or it's unavailable, the upload throws and the rejection is blocked with the error *"Location access is required to reject a job."* This is intentional — the whole point of the photo is on-site verification.
- The `RejectJobModal` (`pages/JobDetail/components/JobDetailModals.tsx`) was extended with a tap-to-capture photo slot using native `<input type="file" capture="environment">` so it works on mobile cameras and desktop file pickers alike. Selecting a photo shows a preview with an X to remove. The confirm button gates on `(reason && photo && !uploading)`. While uploading, both Cancel and Reject Job are disabled, and the button text becomes "Uploading...".
- Helpers, admin-service, and supervisors are unaffected — the rejection flow only renders for lead technicians on jobs in the pre-acceptance state.
- Deferred to a follow-up: a dedicated banner on the admin's view of the rejected job showing the rejection reason and photo thumbnail. For now the photo is visible in the existing job media gallery under the `rejection_proof` category.
- Files: `supabase/migrations/20260407_fix_tech_rejection.sql`, `services/rejectionPhotoUpload.ts`, `services/jobAssignmentCrudService.ts`, `types/job-core.types.ts`, `pages/JobDetail/components/JobDetailModals.tsx`, `pages/JobDetail/hooks/useJobActions.ts`, `pages/JobDetail/hooks/useJobDetailState.ts`, `pages/JobDetail/JobDetailPage.tsx`

## [2026-04-07] — Service Report Show/Hide Prices Confirmation

### Features

**Confirm price visibility before printing service reports**
- Client requested a confirmation prompt when generating service reports so the same job can produce either a customer-facing copy (no prices) or an internal copy (with prices) without needing two separate report templates.
- Clicking **Print Service Report** now opens a small `ReportOptionsModal` with two buttons: **"Hide Prices (Customer Copy)"** (primary) and **"Show Prices (Internal Copy)"** (secondary). Hide-prices is the visually-primary action since most reports are customer-facing.
- The `showPrices` flag is threaded through both render paths in `components/ServiceReportPDF.tsx`: the React component (`ServiceReportPDF`) and the duplicated HTML-string template inside `printServiceReport()`. Gating both was critical — the prices were rendered twice and gating only one would have silently leaked them through the print window.
- When `showPrices === false`, the report omits the "Unit Price" and "Amount(RM)" columns, the empty filler cells for those columns, and the entire `<tfoot>` containing Labor and TOTAL. Quantities, descriptions, item codes, and the rest of the report are unchanged.
- New state `showReportOptionsModal` lives on `useJobDetailState`; `useJobExportActions` exposes a new `handleConfirmPrintServiceReport(showPrices)` that the modal calls. The export modal is also added to `hasModalOpen` so the mobile sticky bar hides while it's open.
- Invoices (`InvoicePDF.tsx`) are unchanged for now — they're invoices, prices belong on them.
- Files: `components/ServiceReportPDF.tsx`, `pages/JobDetail/components/JobDetailModals.tsx`, `pages/JobDetail/components/index.ts`, `pages/JobDetail/hooks/useJobExportActions.ts`, `pages/JobDetail/hooks/useJobDetailState.ts`, `pages/JobDetail/JobDetailPage.tsx`

## [2026-04-07] — Parts Declaration Required Before Completion

### Fixes

**Lead technicians must declare parts usage before completing a job**
- The Complete button was previously enabled even when a technician had neither added any parts nor ticked the "No parts were used" checkbox, allowing jobs to be closed without an explicit parts declaration. Client feedback flagged this as a data-quality issue.
- `JobDetailPage.tsx` now derives `partsDeclared = job.parts_used.length > 0 || noPartsUsed` and `partsDeclarationRequired` (lead technicians only — helpers, admin-service, and supervisors are unaffected). `completionBlocked` includes this condition, gating the mobile sticky-bar Complete button. A new "Parts declaration required" amber chip joins the existing "After photo needed" / "Hourmeter needed" / "Signatures missing" warning row.
- `JobHeader.tsx` (desktop) Complete button now also gates on `partsDeclarationRequired`, with a tooltip reading *"Declare parts usage or tick 'No parts were used'"*.
- `MobileTechnicianWorkflowCard.tsx` accepts a new `partsDeclared` prop and includes "Parts declaration" in its blockers list, so the guided workflow card and its disabled-state messaging stay consistent with the sticky bar.
- The `USER_GUIDE.md` completion checklist already documented this requirement; only the runtime enforcement was missing.
- Files: `pages/JobDetail/JobDetailPage.tsx`, `pages/JobDetail/components/JobHeader.tsx`, `pages/JobDetail/components/MobileTechnicianWorkflowCard.tsx`

## [2026-04-07] — Repair Job Completion Unblocked

### Fixes

**Repair jobs no longer blocked by checklist warning on completion**
- `getMissingMandatoryItems` in `utils.ts` now returns `[]` immediately for `JobType.REPAIR`, enforcing the exemption at the source rather than relying solely on the caller
- Previously, `job_type` being `undefined` (it's optional on the `Job` type) caused `undefined !== 'Repair'` to evaluate `true`, triggering the `ChecklistWarningModal` with all items flagged as missing — permanently blocking completion
- Also: imported `JobType` enum into `useJobActions.ts` and replaced the raw string `'Repair'` with `JobType.REPAIR` at the call site for type safety
- Files: `pages/JobDetail/utils.ts`, `pages/JobDetail/hooks/useJobActions.ts`

---

## [2026-04-06] — Technician View Cleanup + List Row Fix

### Fixes

**QuickStats hidden for technician role**
- Active / New / Assigned / In Progress / Awaiting / Completed stat tiles are now hidden when the logged-in user is a technician
- Those tiles show fleet-wide dispatch counts with admin-centric hints ("Needs assignment", "Queued for dispatch") that are irrelevant noise for technicians
- File: `pages/JobBoard/JobBoard.tsx`

**List row job# column width reverted**
- Previous fix widened the Star+Job# column from 130px → 170px which squeezed adjacent columns
- Reverted to 130px; `whitespace-nowrap` (replacing `truncate`) is sufficient since job numbers fit comfortably within the original width
- File: `pages/JobBoard/components/JobListRow.tsx`

---

## [2026-04-06] — Job Board Auto-Commit Hook + Job Number Readability

### Config

**Stop hook auto-commits FT changes at session end**
- Added an agent-type `Stop` hook to `/home/jay/FT/.claude/settings.json`
- At the end of every Claude session, if uncommitted FT changes exist: the agent updates CHANGELOG.md and WORK_LOG.md then runs `git add -A && git commit && git push`
- Zero overhead when there are no uncommitted changes (exits immediately on clean `git status`)
- Existing TypeScript check Stop hook is unaffected

### Fixes

**Job number no longer squeezed on Job Board**
- List view (JobListRow): Star + Job# column was `w-[130px]` — star icon took ~30px leaving only 100px for the number; long numbers were silently truncated. Widened to `w-[170px]` and replaced `truncate` with `whitespace-nowrap`
- Card view (JobCard): star+badge inner div lacked `shrink-0`, allowing flex layout to compress it; job number badge had no `whitespace-nowrap`, allowing text to wrap mid-number. Both fixed
- Files: `pages/JobBoard/components/JobListRow.tsx`, `pages/JobBoard/components/JobCard.tsx`

---

## [2026-04-06] — External Forklift Fix + Admin Job Description Edit

### Features

**Admin 1 can now edit job description on Job Detail**
- `admin` and `admin_service` (Admin 1) roles now see an **Edit** button next to the Description field on the Job Detail page
- Clicking Edit reveals an inline textarea; Save persists the change via `updateJob`; Cancel reverts with no DB call
- Edit button is hidden on completed jobs and for all other roles (supervisor, technician, accountant, admin_store)
- Files: `pages/JobDetail/components/CustomerAssignmentCard.tsx`, `pages/JobDetail/hooks/useJobDetailState.ts`, `pages/JobDetail/hooks/useJobActions.ts`, `pages/JobDetail/JobDetailPage.tsx`

### Fixes

**External forklift "Add & Select" now correctly creates the forklift instead of submitting the job**
- Root cause: `ExternalForkliftSection` rendered a `<form>` nested inside the outer job creation `<form>` — browsers treat nested forms as invalid HTML and associated the "Add & Select" submit button with the outer form, submitting the job immediately with no forklift linked
- Fix: replaced the inner `<form>` with a `<div>` and changed the button to `type="button" onClick={handleAdd}`
- Secondary fix: `getForkliftsForList` now selects `ownership_type` so the post-creation `useEffect` correctly sets `billing_type: 'chargeable'` for external forklifts instead of resetting it to `'rental-inclusive'`
- Also corrected external forklift creation status from deprecated `'Active'` to `'Available'`
- Files: `pages/CreateJob/components/ExternalForkliftSection.tsx`, `services/forkliftService.ts`, `pages/CreateJob/hooks/useCreateJobForm.ts`

---

## [2026-04-06] — Job Detail Fixes + Inventory Stock Sync

### Data

**Inventory stock sync (Apr 6 snapshot)**
- Strict sync script (`scripts/strict-sync-inventory.py`) applied ACWER's Apr 6 stock snapshot to the `parts` table
- 3,303 items reconciled: names, quantities, costs, categories, and bin locations updated to match source
- 3 extras (`58650-23060`, `S-02474`, `TVH/6656`) retained — referenced in active van stock, cannot be deleted
- Source file: `data/acwer-inventory-cleaned.json` (derived from `Stock_as_at_06.04.26_11.16am.csv`)
- Script: `scripts/strict-sync-inventory.py` — delete extras, insert missing, update common, verify post-sync

---

## [2026-04-06] — Job Detail and Create Job Reliability Fixes

### Fixes

**External Forklift Add flow now keeps the newly created unit selected**
- Creating an external forklift from the Create Job flow succeeded in the database, but the forklift list cache stayed stale
- Root cause: `useForkliftsForList` was not refreshed after `createForklift()`, so the new unit was missing from the dropdown and the form looked like the data vanished
- Fix: invalidate the `['forklifts', 'list']` query immediately after successful external forklift creation so the dropdown reloads and the new forklift remains selectable
- File: `pages/CreateJob/hooks/useCreateJobForm.ts`

**Job Detail Reassign button hardened**
- The reassign entrypoint and modal actions now use explicit `type="button"` behavior instead of relying on implicit button defaults
- This avoids dead or swallowed clicks in the Job Detail reassignment flow and makes the interaction deterministic
- Files: `pages/JobDetail/components/CustomerAssignmentCard.tsx`, `pages/JobDetail/components/JobDetailModals.tsx`

## [2026-04-05] — Technician UX, Bulk Sign Fix, Star Jobs, Van Stock Performance

### Features

**Rejection Proof Photo (mandatory on job rejection)**
- Technicians must now take a live camera photo when rejecting a job assignment
- Canvas overlay burns the timestamp and GPS coordinates directly into the image pixels (tamper-evident, surveillance-style bar at bottom)
- Photo is uploaded to `job-photos` Supabase bucket and stored as a `job_media` record with `category = 'rejection_proof'`
- The rejection reason text is stored in `media.description` so it persists even after the job is reassigned and `technician_rejection_reason` is cleared
- **Timeline**: rejection events now appear in the Job Timeline with thumbnail (lightbox), reason quote, and GPS coordinates
- **Photos section**: `rejection_proof` added as a new `MediaCategory` and filter option
- Files: `RejectJobModal.tsx`, `useJobAcceptance.ts`, `JobBoard.tsx`, `JobTimeline.tsx`, `common.types.ts`, `constants.ts`

**Star Job — Shared Attention Flag**
- Admins, supervisors, and the assigned technician can star a job to flag it as needing attention
- Star is a **shared flag** visible to all users — pinned jobs float to the top of everyone's board (above Emergency and Slot-In SLA)
- DB: `is_starred boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false` on `jobs` table with a partial index (only indexes `true` rows)
- Star button sits beside the job ID on both card and list views; amber colour with ring when starred
- DB migration: `supabase/migrations/20260404_add_job_pinned_by.sql` (renamed to reflect final design)
- Files: `jobStarService.ts`, `useJobFilters.ts`, `JobCard.tsx`, `JobListRow.tsx`, `JobListTable.tsx`, `JobBoard.tsx`, `job-core.types.ts`, `supabaseClient.ts`

**Enriched Job Timeline**
- **Work started** event from `repair_start_time` (only shown when >2 min distinct from `started_at`)
- **Work completed** event from `repair_end_time` — when the after photo was taken and timer stopped
  - Shows after-photo thumbnail (click to open lightbox)
  - GPS coordinates if captured
  - Amber **Repair time: Xh Ym** duration badge
- Vertical connector line between events for visual flow
- Lightbox now covers both rejection proof photos and after photos
- Labels updated: `Job created`, `Job started`, `Work started`, `Work completed`, `Sign-off completed`
- File: `JobTimeline.tsx`

### Fixes

**Signature Name Fix on Job Reassignment**
- When a job was reassigned to a new technician, the old technician's signature persisted — new tech's name never appeared
- Root cause: `reassignJob` cleared `technician_accepted_at` but not `technician_signature`
- Fix: added `technician_signature: null` and `technician_signature_at: null` to the `reassignJob` update payload
- File: `jobAssignmentCrudService.ts`

**Repair Job Checklist Exemption**
- Per client request, Repair job type (`job_type === 'Repair'`) no longer requires the condition checklist
- Checklist section hidden from job detail page for Repair jobs
- Start Job modal (Step 2) hides checklist grid and unblocks the Start button without `allChecked`
- Completion check in `handleStatusChange` skips `getMissingMandatoryItems` for Repair jobs
- Mobile workflow card label reads "Start with photos" instead of "Start with checklist and photos"
- Files: `JobDetailPage.tsx`, `JobDetailModals.tsx`, `useJobActions.ts`, `MobileTechnicianWorkflowCard.tsx`

**Bulk Sign — Wiring, Status Transition, After-Photo Gate**
- `bulkSwipeSignJobs` was writing signatures but never transitioning jobs to `AWAITING_FINALIZATION` — jobs sat permanently as "In Progress" after bulk signing
- Fix: after both signatures succeed, calls `updateJobStatus(AWAITING_FINALIZATION)` per job via `Promise.allSettled` (individual failures don't block others — shows warning count)
- After-photo gate: jobs without an after photo are shown greyed out in the selection list with "upload after photo first" label — only eligible jobs are pre-selected and checkable
- `forklift.serial` → `forklift.serial_number` (field name was wrong, always showed N/A)
- IC number added to submit button disabled guard (was missing, relied only on SwipeToSign disabled state)
- Site address now uses `customer_site.site_name` instead of customer general address
- `SiteSignOffBanner` ready count now only counts jobs with after photo uploaded
- Files: `BulkSignOffModal.tsx`, `SiteSignOffBanner.tsx`

**Van Stock Fast Updates + Searchable Part LOV**
- Van stock data hooks (`useVanStockData`, `useVanStock`) migrated to React Query — mutations now do a background `invalidateVanStock()` instead of `setLoading(true)` + full refetch; no UI blanking
- `useSearchParts` hook added to `useQueryHooks.ts` — server-side part search via `getPartsPage` (same pattern as `useSearchCustomers`)
- `AddItemModal` (van stock) and `AdjustStockModal` (inventory): plain `<select>` replaced with `Combobox` + `useSearchParts`; `availableParts` prop and upfront `getParts()` prefetch removed
- New React Query hooks: `useAllVanStocks`, `useVanStockByTechnician`, `useReplenishmentsPending`, `useReplenishmentsByTech`
- Files: `useQueryHooks.ts`, `useVanStockData.ts`, `useVanStock.ts`, `AddItemModal.tsx`, `AdjustStockModal.tsx`, `VanStockPageMain.tsx`, `InventoryPageMain.tsx`

**Job Parts Combobox — Search by Item Code**
- `partOptions` subLabel updated to include `part_code` as the first element: `PRT-001 · RM12.50 · Stock: 8`
- The existing client-side Combobox filter searches `subLabel`, so admins can now type either a part name or item code to find parts
- File: `JobDetailPage.tsx`

**Continue Tomorrow — Reason Now Saved + No Scroll-to-Top**
- `markJobContinueTomorrow` had a placeholder `notes: supabase.rpc ? undefined : undefined` — reason was only `logDebug`'d, never persisted
- Fix: fetches current notes array and appends `[Continue Tomorrow — DD Mon YYYY — UserName]: reason`; admin can see reason in job Notes section
- `loadJob({ silent: true })` added to prevent scroll-to-top on mobile after confirming
- Files: `jobStatusService.ts`, `useJobActions.ts`

**Part Request Submit — No Scroll-to-Top on Mobile**
- After submitting/approving/rejecting a part request, `loadJob()` called `setLoading(true)` which re-rendered from scratch and scrolled to top
- Fix: `loadJob` accepts `{ silent?: boolean }` option; all post-mutation refreshes in `useJobRequestActions` use `loadJob({ silent: true })`
- Files: `useJobData.ts`, `useJobRequestActions.ts`

### Database Changes

| Table | Change |
|-------|--------|
| `jobs` | Added `is_starred boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false` with partial GIN index |
| `job_media` | `category` constraint updated to include `'rejection_proof'` |

Migration file: `supabase/migrations/20260404_add_job_pinned_by.sql`

## [2026-03-10] - Job Board Performance Optimization

### Performance

- **Removed overfetching** — Board query no longer pulls `parts_used` and `media` arrays per job, cutting payload size significantly.
- **Single-query helper assignments** — Technician helper jobs now fetched in one query via `!inner` join instead of two sequential queries (N+1 fix).
- **Debounced search** — Search input now debounces 250ms via `useDebounce` hook, preventing filter recalculation on every keystroke.
- **Memoized list components** — `JobCard`, `JobListRow`, and `QuickStats` wrapped in `React.memo` to skip re-renders when props haven't changed.
- **Stable callbacks** — `onNavigate` extracted to `useCallback` to avoid creating new function references on every render.
- **Stable realtime subscription** — Channel no longer tears down/recreates on user context changes; uses ref-based pattern for stable `useEffect` deps.
- **Incremental INSERT handling** — New jobs from realtime subscription are prepended to the array instead of triggering a full data refetch.

---

## [2026-03-10] - Jobs Board View Refinement

### UI Improvements

- **Two-mode jobs board** - `/jobs` now supports a stronger card view and a denser list view, with the chosen layout persisted in the URL via `?view=card|list`.
- **Richer job cards** - Cards now surface customer, site, equipment, assignee, schedule, description, SLA/emergency context, and acceptance state without clipping long content.
- **Operational list view** - List mode now behaves like a true board scan with desktop table columns for job, site, equipment, assignee, scheduled date, status, and urgency, while mobile collapses to dense stacked rows instead of a broken horizontal table.
- **Jobs workspace header** - Added a clearer top command area with result counts, view toggle, selection controls, and more structured filter/search presentation.
- **Search coverage expanded** - Jobs search now includes forklift numbers, customer forklift numbers, account numbers, contact person, and site fields used in the redesigned board.

## [2026-03-10] — Admin Forklift Switching

### Features

**Job Detail Forklift Switching**
- **Admin forklift switch** — Admins can now switch the assigned forklift on a job before it starts (status: New or Assigned). This allows correcting forklift assignments without deleting/recreating jobs.
- **Customer rental filtering** — Only forklifts currently rented by the job's customer appear in the switch dropdown, preventing assignment of unavailable equipment.
- **Pre-start restriction** — Forklift can only be switched before job starts (not In Progress, Completed, or Awaiting Finalization). Once work begins, the forklift is locked to preserve hourmeter continuity and job integrity.
- **Inline UX** — Click the RefreshCw icon next to the Equipment header → select from dropdown → saves immediately → refreshes job data. Clean, minimal friction.
- **Toast feedback** — Success/error toasts confirm the switch or explain why it failed.

### Security
- **Admin-only** — Only users with `roleFlags.isAdmin` see the switch button. Supervisors, technicians, and accountants cannot switch forklifts.
- **Status gate** — Backend update checks job status; future enhancement could add server-side validation to block updates after job starts.

## [2026-03-09] — Rental + Hourmeter Import Preparation

### Features

**Dry-Run Import Preparation**
- **Rental + hourmeter prep CLI** — Added `npm run import:prep:dry-run` to parse rental and hourmeter CSVs, compare them against Supabase, and emit a JSON review report without importing any live data.
- **Classification report** — Every in-scope asset is classified as `create`, `update`, or `manual-review`, with preserved raw source values and proposed forklift/rental/hourmeter records.
- **Review buckets** — The dry-run report isolates unresolved customer aliases, unresolved site aliases, missing-identity rows, and excluded non-forklift equipment (`R-HPT`, `R-EQUIP`).
- **Hourmeter summary parser** — Locked the import logic to the grouped 4-row hourmeter summary blocks and ignores the flat debtor/detail section for canonical import decisions.

### Data Model
- **Relational rental site prep** — Added migration support for `forklift_rentals.site_id`, `forklifts.current_site_id`, `forklifts.delivery_date`, and `forklifts.source_item_group`.
- **Customer site import prep** — `customer_sites.address` can now be nullable so imports can stage site names before full addresses are known.
- **Alias mapping tables** — Added `customer_aliases` and `customer_site_aliases` to support reviewable source-name reconciliation instead of hardcoded string guessing.
- **Hourmeter import source** — Extended `hourmeter_history.source` to allow `import` audit entries for the future approval-based import step.

### Tests
- **Import prep parser tests** — Added node-based tests for rental parsing, grouped hourmeter parsing, alias normalization, unresolved site review classification, and hourmeter regression detection.

## [2026-03-07] — Mobile Technician UX + Dashboard Hardening

### Features

**Mobile Technician Workflow**
- **Workflow Card** — Guided field workflow card on mobile job detail: Accept → Start → Work → Complete. Shows only for technicians on phones.
- **Completion gating** — "Complete" button disabled until all requirements met (after photo, hourmeter, tech signature, customer signature). Blocker badges show what's missing.
- **Quick-nav buttons** — Checklist, Photos, Signatures buttons scroll directly to each section.
- **Signatures promoted** — Signatures card moved from sidebar into main content on mobile for visibility.
- **Sticky action bar** — Shows requirement pills (amber badges) when completion is blocked.

**Dashboard Polish**
- **Role-specific dashboards** — ServiceAdminDashboard (jobs pipeline, fleet, team) and StoreAdminDashboard (parts requests, inventory alerts, expiry).
- **Floating top header** — Rounded-[24px] bar with "Operations Console" label, refined glass blur.
- **Sidebar glass gradient** — Softer nav item radius (14px), gradient background.
- **Skeleton loading** — Dashboard shows structured skeletons instead of spinner.
- **Job filter drill-downs** — Dashboard links support `?filter=assigned`, `?filter=due-today`, `?filter=awaiting-service-confirm`.
- **Tab URL params preserved** — Switching tabs no longer wipes other URL parameters.

**Inventory**
- **Permission-based actions** — Inventory buttons use `canEditInventory` instead of hardcoded `isAdmin`, so Admin Store can manage inventory correctly.
- **URL param sync** — Search, category, and stock filters sync with URL params.

**Performance**
- **Per-role dashboard code splitting** — Each role's dashboard is now a separate lazy-loaded chunk via `React.lazy()`. Technician loads 7.8KB instead of the full 31KB admin dashboard.
- **Inventory catalog pagination** — Parts list paginated at 50 per page with server-side filtering. Stats computed from lightweight select.
- **Centralized parts service** — Typed `PartsCatalogPage`, `InventoryCatalogStats`, shared low/out-of-stock helpers.

### Fixes
- **Native confirm/alert replaced** — All fleet pages (forklift delete, service interval delete, end rental) now use themed confirmation modals instead of browser native dialogs. Consistent with CustomerProfile pattern.
- **DashboardSection extracted** — Was duplicated in ServiceAdmin + StoreAdmin dashboards; now shared from `DashboardWidgets.tsx`.
- **Store dashboard error handling** — Added `try/catch/finally` with loading skeleton + error fallback with retry button. Previously failed silently.
- **FAB cleanup** — Removed redundant technician FAB actions (Van Stock, My Jobs) that duplicated bottom nav.
- **JobCard acceptance badge** — Only shows on ASSIGNED status, not after job starts.
- **ExpiryWarning typed** — Removed `any` type in inventory page.

---

## [2026-03-06] — Admin UI Clarity Pass

### UI Improvements

**Dashboard**
- **Stronger admin command-center header** — Added a clearer top summary with date context, a more useful opening sentence, and four actionable focus cards for due work, approvals, assignment gaps, and team capacity.
- **Watchlist strip** — Grouped the quick KPI pills into a labeled watchlist so the signal reads as one control surface instead of a loose row of chips.
- **Urgent queue cleanup** — Deduplicated Action Required items so the same job no longer appears multiple times for overlapping urgency reasons.

**Jobs**
- **Jobs overview cards refined** — Quick stat cards now explain what each number means (open work, queued work, finance step, closed jobs) instead of showing count-only tiles.
- **Filter bar simplified** — Search, status, date chips, and advanced filters now read as one coherent control area with a clearer result count and less top-of-page clutter.
- **Better loading state** — Replaced the blank spinner with skeletons shaped like the actual jobs page.

**Fleet**
- **Fleet summary row** — Added top-level cards for total units, available units, rented units, and maintenance attention items.
- **Fleet filter panel improved** — Added clear counts and a dedicated clear-filters action.
- **Forklift cards denser but easier to scan** — Reduced duplicate status noise, surfaced internal/customer forklift numbers, clarified rental state, and improved customer/site context.
- **Fleet loading state** — Replaced empty spinner loading with structure-aware skeletons.

**Customers**
- **Customer summary cards** — Added top stats for total customers, phone coverage, email coverage, and profiles with notes.
- **Search area improved** — Added clearer search result feedback and a dedicated clear-search action.
- **Customer cards upgraded** — Added contact-readiness badges, contact person emphasis, note treatment, and a clearer profile CTA.

**Role-Specific Dashboards**
- **Service Admin dashboard** — Focused on jobs pipeline, technician availability, fleet snapshot (service due, rented units), and team workload. No inventory clutter.
- **Store Admin dashboard** — Focused on parts requests queue, inventory alerts (out-of-stock, low stock), and recent receiving activity. No job management clutter.
- **Super Admin** — Retains the full "Command Center" dashboard with everything.

### Fixes
- **Swipe-sign TypeScript regressions** — Restored missing `swipeSignJob` / `bulkSwipeSignJobs` barrel exports and fixed incorrect `showToast(...)` usage in the bulk sign-off modal so `npm run typecheck` passes again.
- **Customer delete FK cascade** — Deleting a customer now properly cleans up all job dependencies (`hourmeter_history`, `job_parts`, `job_media`, etc.) before removing the customer. Also checks for active rentals.
- **Themed delete confirmation** — Replaced native browser `confirm()`/`alert()` with themed modal and toast notifications on the Customer Profile page.
- **UsersTab crash on new roles** — Role badge map was missing `admin_service` and `admin_store`, causing a crash when viewing the Users tab. Added badges with distinct colors and proper display labels ("Admin (Service)", "Admin (Store)").
- **Dashboard role switch** — Added explicit `admin_service`/`admin_store` cases to dashboard component routing.
- **HashRouter deep-link** — Bookmarked URLs like `/jobs` now correctly redirect to `/#/jobs`.
- **Hard delete job** — Added `hourmeter_history` cleanup to prevent FK constraint errors.
- **Dev account access** — Restored `isAdmin` check on duplicate/delete job buttons so the super admin account isn't locked out.

## [2026-03-06] — Signatures, Role Separation & Service Tracking

### Features

**Swipe-to-Sign System**
- **Replaced draw-on-canvas signatures with swipe-to-sign** — Technician swipes a slider to confirm; customer fills in Name + IC Number then swipes. Faster, cleaner, works better on mobile.
- **Customer IC Number required** — Customer must enter their name and IC number before the swipe slider becomes active.
- **Inline signing in Job Detail** — No more modal popups; signature fields are directly in the Signatures card.

**Bulk Site Sign-Off**
- **Bulk sign-off banner on Job Board** — When a technician has 2+ unsigned in-progress jobs at the same customer + site, a "Sign Off Site Visit" banner appears.
- **Two-step bulk modal** — Step 1: Tech selects jobs + swipes. Step 2: Customer fills name + IC + swipes. One signature upload applies to all selected jobs.
- **`bulkSwipeSignJobs` service** — Signs multiple jobs with a single operation.

**Role-Based Access: Admin Service vs Admin Store**
- **Admin 1 (Service)** — Full job management (create, assign, edit, delete), customers, forklifts, fleet, HR, users, invoices. NO inventory access.
- **Admin 2 (Store)** — Full inventory/parts management, approve & provide parts, invoices. Read-only job view. NO job creation/editing, NO customers/forklifts/HR.
- **Mobile nav split** — Service admin sees Home/Jobs/Fleet; Store admin sees Home/Jobs/Inventory.
- **FAB split** — Service admin gets New Job + Approvals; Store admin gets Approvals + Inventory.
- **Job Detail restricted** — Store admin cannot start, complete, delete, duplicate, or reassign jobs.

**Service Tracking**
- **Reach Truck treated as Electric** — `isElectricType()` helper recognizes Reach Truck as electric for calendar-based 3-month service tracking. `getServiceIntervalType()` maps Reach Truck → Electric intervals.

### Fixes
- **Duplicate Job button** — Was navigating to `/jobs/create` (wrong route), now correctly goes to `/jobs/new`.
- **Job Detail address** — Shows only site address selected during job creation, no longer falls back to customer office address.

---

## [2026-03-05] — March 2026 UX & Workflow Improvements

**Job Management**
- **Create Job page redesign** — Clean 2-column desktop layout with context sidebar showing customer info, active rentals, recent jobs. Mobile stacks single column.
- **Job Board date filter pill tabs** — Replaced dropdown with pill navigation (Unfinished/Today/Week/Month/All).
- **Job Detail page widened** — Eliminated thick side margins for better use of screen space.
- **Schedule Service modal** — Desktop-friendly 2-column layout.
- **Camera-only Start Job photos** — Mandatory before-condition photo capture (min 1 photo) before entering hourmeter/checklist. 2-step wizard. Camera/gallery mode, no upload from old photos. Prevents fake photos with timestamp + geolocation.

**UI Components**
- **Searchable Combobox dropdowns** — Replaced native select elements across fleet filters, inventory filters, job filters, forklift edit modal. Type to filter, keyboard navigation.
- **Compact liquid glass Combobox** — Special variant for filter bars with glassmorphism effect, tighter spacing.

- **Currency RM fix** — Inventory views now display Malaysian Ringgit (RM) instead of $.

### Fixes
- **Modal overflow fix** — All modals now use 2-layer pattern (outer wrapper + inner scrollable). Prevents content clipping on small viewports and mobile.
- **Modal clipping on mobile** — Fixed top clipping and screen flicker. Rental modal bottom buttons no longer cut off.
- **Service Due tab** — Prediction view now returns `current_hourmeter` correctly (was showing `hourmeter`).
- **Category filter overflow** — Fixed with proper width constraints, text truncation, min-width.
- **Search service query chain** — Fixed stacked `.is()` bug causing search failures.
- **Year field** — Changed from required (defaulting to current year) to optional (null default).
- **Bulk rent modal** — Last Service Hourmeter field hidden on bulk rent (only shows for single forklift).
- **Pagination** — Parts queries now paginate to fetch all 3200+ items.
- **Null-safe toFixed** — Fixed crash on null `sell_price`/`cost_price`.
- **Forklift dropdown empty** — Fixed missing `current_customer_id` in query.
- **Notification dedup** — Skip if same user+type+ref exists within 5min window.
- **Service Worker cache** — Removed JS/CSS from CacheFirst runtime caching. Prevents stale chunks after deploys.

### Performance

### Maintenance
- **Project cleanup** — Removed 977 lines of dead code (orphaned components, unused services, stale exports).
- **Codifica protocol** — Added multi-agent coordination spec for better context handoff.
- **Documentation updates** — Comprehensive README overhaul, added LICENSE, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md.

### Testing
- **E2E test suites** — Added role-based test suites for admin, supervisor, technician, and accountant workflows.

## [2026-02-27] — Liquid Inventory Phase 1

### Features
- **Purchase/Receive Stock flow** — Admin enters container qty × size (liters) + total price → auto-calculates total liters and cost per liter (RM). PO reference stored per batch.
- **Warehouse Ledger tab** — Running balance table per fluid item: purchase, van transfer, job usage, special sale. Color-coded ± changes with reference numbers.
- **Van Ledger tab** — Per-van running balance. Negative balance rows highlighted amber as warning flag for admin review.
- **Cost tracking (average costing)** — purchase_batches stores cost per liter per batch. update_avg_cost_per_liter() maintains weighted average. Forklift maintenance cost auto-calculated on job usage (qty × avg cost/L).
- **Decimal input on liquid parts** — Removed all + counter buttons on fluid items. Replaced with manual decimal text input (inputMode=decimal) supporting values like 4.2L.
- **Insufficient balance guard** — Van deductions that would go negative are flagged for admin review.

### Database
- purchase_batches extended: container_size_liters, total_purchase_price_myr, received_by, received_at
- inventory_movements added: reference_number, unit_cost_at_time, total_cost, forklift_id
- parts added: avg_cost_per_liter, last_purchase_cost_per_liter
- New enum values: van_transfer, job_usage, special_sale

---

## [2026-02-26] - February 26, 2026

### Features
- **Auto-generated job numbers** — DB trigger assigns `JOB-YYYYMMDD-XXXX` on insert; existing jobs backfilled; job number badge displayed on job cards and job detail header (blue accent pill style); searchable via global search
- **Technician mobile UX overhaul** — My Jobs / Other Jobs tab split; colored status borders on cards (green = completed, yellow = in-progress, red = open); larger tap targets throughout; collapsible sections on job detail page

### Bug Fixes
- **Sticky action bar** — Moved to top of job detail; hides automatically when modals are open to prevent overlap
- **Hourmeter validation** — Allow equal hourmeter reading on job complete (handles case where forklift was not operational during job)
- **Signature images** — Now use permanent public URLs instead of signed URLs (fixes 24-hour expiry issue)
- **Post-completion notes** — Technicians can add notes (but not photo uploads) after a job has been marked complete
- **Confirmation card** — Fixed mobile overflow on confirmation summary card
- **Checklist grid** — Single-column layout on mobile; overflow handling on long checklist labels
- **Call button** — Moved below customer name for better visual hierarchy

- **CreateJob page** — Job type and priority fields now use Combobox component for consistency
- **Toast notifications** — Moved to top-center position; close button removed for cleaner mobile UX
- **Sticky status pill** — Removed redundant pill and blank gap on mobile job detail (status is already shown in action bar)

---

## [2026-02-24/25] - Liquid Inventory System + Bulk Parts Import

### Features
- **Dual-unit inventory foundation** — Parts now support two quantity types: discrete units (pcs) and liquid/bulk (L, kg, m); `unit` field and `liquid_quantity`/`liquid_unit` columns added across `parts`, `van_stock_items`, `job_parts`, and `replenishment_items` tables
- **Liquid inventory service** — `liquidInventoryService.ts` handles liquid-aware stock read/write; `partsService.ts` updated for dual-unit support
- **Liquid-aware stock deduction in job flow** — When a liquid part is used on a job, the liquid quantity is deducted correctly (in addition to or instead of unit count)
- **Dual-unit UI across all pages** — Inventory page, Van Stock modal, parts dropdowns all show unit type and appropriate quantity inputs
- **Bulk parts import** — Admin can import parts from CSV or JSON file; validates headers, upserts by part code; progress feedback with success/error counts
- **Inventory movement logging** — All stock changes (deductions, replenishments, manual adjustments) now logged to `inventory_movements` table with actor, job, quantity delta, and timestamp
- **Low stock alerts** — Server-side function evaluates low-stock threshold per part; alert surfaced on admin dashboard; better CSV export with all columns

---

## [2026-02-23] - Checklist Tri-State, Decimal Qty, Combobox Portal Fix

### Features
- **Checklist tri-state toggle** — Previously, clicking an OK item just cleared it (blank). Now it shows a red ✗ (needs attention). Three states: blank → ✓ OK → ✗ Not OK → blank. Gives technicians a clearer visual for issues they're flagging.
- **Decimal quantity input for parts** — Technicians can type exact amounts (1.5, 0.5, 0.25) instead of tapping a "+" button. Supports liquid/bulk items. Validates: > 0, ≤ available stock. DB: quantity columns altered to `DECIMAL(10,2)` across affected tables.
- **Smart pre-commit hook v2** — Validates Codex authorship via git trailer; blocks non-Codex commits on code files

### Bug Fixes
- **Combobox portal fix** — Combobox dropdown now renders at the document body level via React portal, making it immune to `overflow: hidden` on parent containers. Fixes dropdowns being clipped inside SwipeableRow, approval cards, and other overflow-constrained parents.

---

## [2026-02-18/19] — Mobile Polish + Dark Mode + Theme Fixes

### Bug Fixes
- **Dark mode theming** — Replaced `bg-white` with `bg-[var(--surface)]` across 73 components — all pages now fully theme-aware
- **Bottom nav dark mode** — Dark background + light border in dark mode (was transparent)
- **FAB fixes** — Solid white backgrounds on menu items, blue glow on main button, closes on route change
- **FAB active label** — Solid accent background with white text (was transparent)
- **Technician FAB** — Replaced "New Job" (no permission) with Van Stock + My Jobs quick actions
- **KPI cards** — Fixed overflow on mobile — smaller padding/font/icons, tighter 3-col grid
- **Dashboard mobile** — Scrollable stat pills, stacking header on small screens
- **Low stock card** — Queries global `parts` table instead of `van_stock_items`; fixed race condition; excludes 0/0 items; scrollable list
- **Command palette** — Fixed transparent background on dark mode
- **Dashboard card overlap** — Fixed layout collision on mobile

---

## [2026-02-17] - Full Mobile Responsive + PWA + Role-Aware Mobile UX + UI Upgrade

---

## [2026-02-16] - Van History, Decimal Quantities, Bug Fixes

### Approvals Tab (StoreQueue) — Grouped Accordion
- **Grouped by job** — requests for the same job now collapse into one accordion card
- **Collapsed by default** — header shows: job title, customer, technician, item count badge, time since oldest request
- **Expand to see details** — click card to reveal individual part requests with inline approve/reject
- **"Approve All" per job** — approves all part requests for a job in one click (only shows when all parts selected)
- **Sorted by latest** — groups sorted by most recent item, newest first
- **Batch-optimized** — Approve All skips per-item reload/toast, single summary toast + reload at end
- File: `StoreQueue/StoreQueuePage.tsx`

### Pending Confirmations Page (standalone) — Collapsed Cards
- **Collapsed cards by default** — job cards now show compact header only (title, customer, tech, time pending, parts count)
- **Expand/collapse accordion** — click card or chevron to see full details (parts list, SRN, completion date, confirmation status)
- **Sort by latest** — most recently completed jobs appear first (both Parts and Jobs tabs)
- **Always-visible actions** — Confirm/Reject buttons visible on collapsed view, no need to expand
- **Tab switch resets** — switching tabs collapses all cards and clears selections
- Files: `PendingConfirmations.tsx`, `JobCard.tsx`, `usePendingConfirmations.ts`

### Broken Notification Bell on V7.1 Dashboard
- **Fixed:** Bell button next to V7.1 badge navigated to `/notifications` — route doesn't exist (blank page)
- **Removed** duplicate bell from dashboard — global header already has `NotificationBell` with working dropdown
- **Cleaned up** unused `Bell` import, `useNotifications` fetch, and `unreadCount` variable (saves an unnecessary API call)
- File: `components/dashboards/DashboardPreviewV4/components/AdminDashboardV7_1.tsx`

### "Failed to mark out of stock" Bug Fix
- **Fixed:** Inline "Out of Stock" button on pending requests passed empty string as partId (no part selected yet → invalid UUID → update fails)
- **Removed** the broken inline OOS shortcut from `JobRequestsSection.tsx`
- **OOS flow still works** via the Approve Request modal where admin selects a part first, then can mark OOS
- File: `pages/JobDetail/components/JobRequestsSection.tsx`

### Part Request Auto-Refresh Fix
- **Fixed:** Technician submits a part request → job doesn't refresh, request invisible until manual reload
- **Fixed:** Same issue when editing an existing request
- **Root cause:** `handleCreateRequest` and `handleUpdateRequest` were missing `loadJob()` call after success (every other handler had it)
- **Also fixed:** React dependency arrays updated to include `loadJob`
- File: `pages/JobDetail/hooks/useJobRequestActions.ts`

### Parts Inventory Bug Fix
- **Fixed:** Parts dropdown in job detail showed "Stock: undefined" — `getPartsForList()` wasn't fetching `stock_quantity`
- **Fixed:** Admin was blocked from adding out-of-stock parts — now only technicians are restricted
- **Fixed:** Stock could go negative when adding parts — clamped to `Math.max(0, ...)`
- **Added:** Visual stock indicators in parts dropdown: ⛔ OOS (zero), ⚠️ low stock (≤5), normal count otherwise
- Files: `partsService.ts`, `jobInvoiceService.ts`, `JobDetailPage.tsx`

### Van History Tab
- **History tab** in van detail modal — shows full parts deduction log with technician, job, quantity, and timestamp
- **Technician summary** sub-tab — which technicians used a van, how many jobs/parts, date ranges
- Paginated log (20 per page) with part codes, units, and customer names
- New service: `vanHistoryService.ts` with `getVanUsageHistory()` and `getVanTechnicianSummary()`

### Decimal Quantity Input
- **Manual quantity entry** replaces the "+" button for van stock parts — technicians can type exact amounts (e.g., 1.5L)
- Supports decimal values for liquid/bulk items (hydraulic oil, lubricant, etc.)
- Shows available quantity with unit in the van stock selector dropdown
- Validates: must be > 0, cannot exceed available stock
- `unit` field added to Part type (pcs, L, kg, m, etc.)
- DB migration: quantity columns altered from INTEGER to DECIMAL(10,2) across van_stock_items, van_stock_usage, job_parts, replenishment_items

### Bulk Part Request Approval
- Already existed! "Approve All" button appears when 2+ requests are pending
- Auto-matches request descriptions to parts inventory with fuzzy keyword matching
- Admin can review, adjust parts/quantities, skip individual items, then approve all at once

### Migration
- `20260216_van_history_and_decimal_quantities.sql`

---

## [2026-02-12] - Van Fleet Management

### Fleet Management System
- **Fleet Overview panel** — Admin/Supervisor collapsible panel at top of Van Stock tab showing all vans with status, plate number, tech, item count, and temp assignments
- **Van status tracking** — Toggle vans between Active / In Service / Decommissioned with one click
- **Temp tech assignment** — Assign/remove temporary technicians to vans (e.g., when their van is in service)
- **Tech van requests** — Technicians can request access to available vans with reason; supervisors approve/reject
- **Auto-assignment on approval** — Approving a request automatically assigns the temp tech to the van
- **Audit trail** — Full timeline of all status changes, temp assignments, and requests per van
- **Van identification** — Edit plate numbers and van codes inline from fleet overview
- **Smart van resolution** — `getVanStockByTechnician` now checks temp assignments first, falls back to own van
- DB tables: `van_access_requests`, `van_audit_log`
- DB columns: `van_status`, `van_plate`, `temporary_tech_id/name`, `temp_assigned_at` on `van_stocks`
- Migration: `20260212_van_fleet_management.sql`

---

## [2026-02-12] - Van Selection for Job Parts

### Van Stock Hardening (Codex Review Findings)
- **Fix: Stale quantity race condition** — Restock now uses atomic SQL `quantity = quantity + N` via `increment_van_stock_quantity()` RPC instead of read-then-write
- **Fix: Van lock enforced server-side** — DB trigger `prevent_van_change_after_parts` blocks van change if `from_van_stock` parts exist on job. No longer UI-only.
- **Fix: Lightweight van dropdown** — New `getActiveVansList()` returns only van metadata (no items) for technician dropdown. Reduces data leakage + payload size.
- DB migration: `20260212_van_stock_hardening.sql`

### Van Stock Bug Fixes (4 issues)
- **Fix: "Unknown" van cards** — `technician_name` wasn't mapped from joined `technician` object in `getAllVanStocks`, `getVanStockById`, and `getVanStockByTechnician`
- **Fix: Replenishment blocked for existing items** — Parts with qty 0 / "Out" status can now be restocked via Add Item (increments qty instead of blocking)
- **Fix: Edit Van Details save** — Changed empty notes from `undefined` to empty string to prevent Supabase rejection
- **Fix: Data mapping consistency** — All van stock fetch functions now consistently resolve `technician_name` from the joined user relation

### Van Selection Feature
- **New:** Technicians can select which van they're using at the start of each job
- Parts list filters to show only parts available in the selected van
- Parts deductions go to the correct van's inventory
- Pre-selects technician's default assigned van (no extra clicks for normal flow)
- Van selection locks after first part is used from van stock (prevents inventory inconsistency)
- No impact on warehouse stock flow

### Files Changed
- `types/job-core.types.ts` — Added `job_van_stock_id` field to Job type
- `pages/JobDetail/hooks/useJobData.ts` — Fetch van stock by job's selected van
- `pages/JobDetail/hooks/useJobDetailState.ts` — Added `availableVans` state
- `pages/JobDetail/hooks/useJobPartsHandlers.ts` — Added `handleSelectJobVan` handler
- `pages/JobDetail/components/PartsSection.tsx` — Van selector dropdown UI
- `pages/JobDetail/JobDetailPage.tsx` — Wired new props
- `database/migrations/20260212_job_van_selection.sql` — DB migration

## [2026-02-07] - Security Fixes & Code Cleanup

### ESLint Zero Warnings (Phase 3 Complete)
- **353 → 0 warnings** — Full lint cleanup achieved
- **Unused catch variables** (~140) — Renamed to `_error`/`_e` convention
- **Empty blocks** (33) — Added explicit `/* Silently ignore */` comments
- **useEffect deps** (31) — Added eslint-disable for intentional mount-only hooks
- **max-lines** (29 files) — File-level disables pending proper splitting
- **ESLint config** — Added `varsIgnorePattern`, `caughtErrorsIgnorePattern`, `destructuredArrayIgnorePattern`
- **Ignored directories** — tests/, public/, scripts/ excluded from linting

### File Modularization (Phase 4)
Successfully split large files for better maintainability:

| Original File | New Files | Reduction |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| `types/job.types.ts` (678 lines) | 5 files: job-core, job-hourmeter, job-quotation, job-request, job-validation | -91% (59 lines) |
| `services/jobAssignmentService.ts` (453 lines) | 3 files: jobAssignmentCrudService, jobAssignmentBulkService + facade | -94% (27 lines) |
| `utils/useRealtimeNotifications.ts` (477 lines) | 3 files: notificationHandlers, realtimeChannels + hook | -49% (244 lines) |
| `services/hourmeterService.ts` (678 lines) | servicePredictionService.ts | -61% (262 lines) |
| `pages/JobDetail/components/JobDetailModals.tsx` (666 lines) | JobDetailModalsSecondary.tsx | -38% (411 lines) |
| `services/jobRequestService.ts` (452 lines) | jobRequestApprovalService.ts | -62% (171 lines) |
| `pages/JobDetail/hooks/useJobActions.ts` (870 lines) | useJobPartsHandlers.ts | -8% (798 lines) |

**25 large files remain** with `eslint-disable max-lines` — these are mostly:
- PDF generators (template-heavy, hard to split)
- Dashboard previews (prototype components)
- Complex hooks (need careful refactoring)

### Code Cleanup (Phase 1 & 2)
- **Import organization** — Removed unused imports across 372 files
- **ESLint fixes** — Reduced issues from 450 to 385 (65 fixed)
- **Type safety** — Fixed `var` to `let/const`, prefixed unused params with `_`
- **Service modularization** — Split `jobService.ts` into focused modules:
  - `jobStatusService.ts` — Status transitions, multi-day job flow
  - `jobCrudService.ts` — Delete/restore operations
  - `jobAutoCountService.ts` — AutoCount export stubs

## [2026-02-07] - Security Fixes: XSS & Storage Hardening

### Security Fixes
- **XSS protection in PDF generators** — All user-controlled content now sanitized before injection
- **Signed URLs for signatures** — `uploadToStorage()` now returns file path instead of public URL
- **Time-limited access** — Signature URLs now expire after 24 hours (vs permanent public URLs)
- **New helper** — `getSignedStorageUrl()` for generating signed URLs on demand

### Technical Details

**XSS Prevention:**
- New `services/sanitizeService.ts` — HTML entity encoder for user content
- Fixed all 5 PDF generators using `document.write()`:
  - `components/InvoicePDF.tsx`
  - `components/QuotationPDF.tsx`
  - `components/ServiceReportPDF.tsx`
  - `pages/Invoices/components/generateInvoicePDF.ts`
  - `pages/ServiceRecords/ServiceReportPDF.ts`

**Storage Hardening:**
- `services/storageService.ts` — Returns `data.path` instead of `getPublicUrl()`
- `services/supabaseClient.ts` — Same change + added `getSignedStorageUrl()` helper
- `services/jobMediaService.ts` — Updated `signJob()` to generate signed URL after upload

### Why This Matters
Public URLs are permanent and shareable — if leaked via browser history, email, or logs, anyone can access the document forever. Signed URLs expire, limiting exposure window.

## [2026-02-04] - Hourmeter Service Prediction System

### New Feature: Engine Hour-Based Service Prediction

Predicts next service date for Diesel, LPG, and Petrol forklifts based on hourmeter usage patterns.

#### How It Works
1. **Collects Data:** Last service hourmeter, current hourmeter, service interval
2. **Calculates Average Usage:** Hours used ÷ days since last reading = avg hrs/day
3. **Predicts Service Date:** Hours until service ÷ avg hrs/day = days remaining
4. **Auto-Resets:** After service completion, cycle restarts automatically
5. **Updates Dynamically:** Every new reading recalculates the prediction

#### Database Changes
- `forklifts` table: Added `last_service_hourmeter`, `service_interval_hours` columns
- New `hourmeter_readings` table: Tracks all hourmeter readings with timestamps
- `calculate_predicted_service_date()` function: Server-side prediction calculation
- `complete_forklift_service()` function: Resets tracking after service
- `v_forklift_service_predictions` view: Dashboard-ready predictions with urgency

#### New Files
- `services/hourmeterService.ts` — Extended with service prediction functions
- `components/hourmeter/HourmeterReadingForm.tsx` — Record hourmeter readings
- `components/hourmeter/ServicePredictionCard.tsx` — Display prediction info
- `components/hourmeter/ServicePredictionDashboard.tsx` — Dashboard widget
- `database/migrations/20260204_hourmeter_service_prediction.sql` — Full migration

#### Types Added
- `HourmeterReading` — Individual reading record
- `ServicePrediction` — Calculation result
- `ForkliftWithPrediction` — Forklift with prediction data
- `ServicePredictionDashboard` — Dashboard widget data
- `ServiceUrgency` — Urgency levels (overdue, due_soon, upcoming, ok)

#### Service Functions
- `recordHourmeterReading()` — Log a new reading
- `getHourmeterReadings()` — Fetch reading history
- `getServicePrediction()` — Get prediction for one forklift
- `getForkliftServicePredictions()` — Get all predictions
- `getServicePredictionDashboard()` — Dashboard data grouped by urgency
- `completeForkliftService()` — Reset after service
- `updateServiceInterval()` — Change service interval

#### Helpers
- `requiresHourmeterTracking()` — Check if forklift type needs tracking
- `formatDaysRemaining()` — Human-readable countdown
- `getUrgencyColor()` — CSS classes for urgency display

### Migration Required
Run `20260204_hourmeter_service_prediction.sql` on Supabase to enable the feature.

### Update (Same Day) - Client Feedback

#### Split Service Job Types
- `Full Service` — PM with oil change, resets hourmeter cycle
- `Minor Service` — PM without oil change, tracks work but no reset
- Legacy `Service` type still works (treated as Full Service)

#### Auto Service Intervals by Forklift Type
- Diesel → 500 hours
- LPG/Petrol → 350 hours
- Trigger `trg_set_service_interval` auto-applies on forklift create/update

#### Automation Triggers
- `on_service_job_completed()` — Auto-resets hourmeter when Full Service job completed
- `set_service_interval_by_type()` — Auto-sets interval based on forklift type

## [2026-02-03] - Security Fixes (Codex Review)

### Critical Fixes

#### 1. Race Condition in Spare Parts Approval — FULLY FIXED
- **Issue:** Separate stock check and update allowed overselling
- **Fix (v1):** Atomic update with WHERE clause
- **Fix (v2):** New SQL function `reserve_part_stock()` with row-level locking
- **Files:** `services/jobRequestService.ts`, `supabase/migrations/20260203_atomic_stock_reserve.sql`
- **Rollback:** `rollback_part_stock()` function for failure recovery

#### 2. Assistance Approval Bug  
- **Issue:** Request marked approved before helper assignment, causing false positives
- **Fix:** Assign helper FIRST, only mark approved if successful
- **File:** `services/jobRequestService.ts`

#### 3. Telegram Token Security
- **Issue:** Base64 JSON token allowed potential forgery
- **Fix:** Added expiry timestamp (5 min), nonce for replay protection
- **File:** `components/TelegramConnect.tsx`
- **Note:** Server-side validation required in webhook

### Security Improvements

#### Dev Mode Protection
- **Issue:** Hardcoded `dev@test.com` could be exploited
- **Fix:** Removed hardcoded email, dev mode only works in dev environment
- **File:** `hooks/useDevMode.ts`

#### Signed URLs for HR Documents
- **Issue:** HR documents (permits, licenses, profile photos) used public URLs
- **Fix:** Implemented signed URLs with 1-hour expiry
- **Files:** `permitService.ts`, `licenseService.ts`, `hrService.ts`, `leaveService.ts`
- **New methods:** `getPermitDocumentUrl()`, `getLicenseImageUrl()`, `getProfilePhotoUrl()`, `getLeaveDocumentUrl()`

#### Gemini API Key Documentation
- Added security notes about client-side key exposure
- Documented mitigations and production recommendations
- **File:** `services/geminiService.ts`

### Database Changes
- `reserve_part_stock(UUID, INTEGER)` — Atomic stock reservation with row lock
- `rollback_part_stock(UUID, INTEGER)` — Undo stock reservation

  - Root cause: Trigger tried to cast string 'ok' to boolean
  - Fix: Now handles both old (true/false) and new ('ok'/'not_ok') formats
  
- **Job completion validation** — Fixed "Job was never started (started_at is null)" error
  - Root cause: Status dropdown path didn't sync `started_at` to service record
  - Fix: Now checks `jobs.started_at`, `repair_start_time`, and `arrival_time` as fallbacks
  - Added trigger to auto-sync job timestamps to service records

### Database Changes
- `validate_job_checklist()` — Handles string checklist states
- `validate_job_completion_requirements()` — Checks multiple timestamp sources
- `sync_job_started_to_service_record()` — New trigger for timestamp sync
- Backfill migration for existing service records

- **Supervisors** can add parts from Assigned onwards
- **Accountants** can only add at Awaiting Finalization (invoice adjustments)
- UI shows "(Pre-allocation)" label when adding parts to New/Assigned jobs
- Simplified and clarified `canAddParts` logic

### Request Edit Capability
- **Technicians** can now edit their own pending requests
- Edit button appears next to "Pending" requests they created
- Only works while request status is 'pending' (before admin review)
- Can modify: request type, description, photo URL
- Modal reused from create flow with edit mode support
- Service validates ownership + pending status before allowing update

### Dashboard Prototypes (All Roles)
- **Admin V5** — Option C style: full-width sections, top 5 items, "View all" links
- **Admin V6** — Full-featured prototype with:
  - Smart context-aware greeting ("5 jobs today, 2 techs available • ⚠️ 1 escalation")
  - Quick Actions row (Assign Jobs, Generate Invoices, Send Reminders)
  - 6 KPI cards including SLA metrics (On-Time %, Avg Response Time)
  - Today's Schedule timeline with visual job status
  - Notification filters (All/Jobs/Requests/System)
  - Outstanding Invoices card
  - Today's Progress bar
  - Team Status with grouped chips
- **Supervisor V5** — Team-focused with layout options (C: Top 5, D: Grouped)
- Toggle V4/V5/V6 via buttons in header (`dev@test.com` only)

### Performance: Egress Optimization
- Added `getUsersLightweight` (7 cols vs 30+)
- Dashboard now uses lightweight queries
- `getEmployees` no longer fetches nested data by default
- Estimated 70-80% reduction in egress for list views

## [2026-03-03] — Inventory Data Quality + Forklift Form Redesign

### Added
- **ACWER CSV self-import** — In-app CSV import with ACWER format auto-detection (3 header rows, 7 columns). Batch upserts (100/batch), audit trail (purchase for new, adjustment for changes), junk row filtering, smart liquid detection, category auto-mapping
- **Forklift form redesign** — New fields: Customer Forklift No (alphanumeric), Site (free text). DB migration added columns. Brand dropdown (Toyota, Nichiyu, Hangcha, BT, EP, Noblelift, TCM, Unicarries, Yale, Nissan, Others). Updated ForkliftType enum: Battery/Electrical, Diesel, Reach Truck, LPG, Others
- **Last Service Hourmeter in rental modals** — Optional field in both AssignForkliftModal instances (fleet list + forklift profile). Sets last_service_hourmeter, recalculates next_target_service_hour
- **Post-bulk-rent Service Reset Modal** — After bulk rent, shows table of rented forklifts with editable Last Service HRS column for batch hourmeter updates

### Fixed
- **Service Due tab** — Prediction view returns `current_hourmeter` not `hourmeter`; fixed ServiceDueTab.tsx
- **Category filter overflow** — InventoryFilters.tsx fixed with `lg:w-48`, `truncate`, `min-w-0`
- **Search service query chain** — Fixed stacked `.is()` bug in searchService.ts
- **Year field** — Changed from required (defaulting to current year) to optional (null default)
- **Bulk rent modal** — Last Service Hourmeter field hidden on bulk rent (only shows for single forklift)
- **Pagination** — Parts queries now paginate to fetch all 3200+ items
- **Null-safe toFixed** — Fixed crash on null sell_price/cost_price

## [2026-03-04] — Batch Receive Stock + Purchase History + Security Hardening

### Added
- **Batch Receive Stock redesign** — Search-based item selection (replaces dropdown), invoice/receipt upload to private Supabase bucket with signed URLs, liquid container context display
- **Purchase History** — 3-way toggle in Ledger tab: Recent Activity / Purchase History / Item Ledger. Batch grouping by PO+date, invoice viewer via signed URLs (1-hour expiry), search filter
- **Before-condition photo step** — Mandatory camera/gallery photo capture (min 1 photo) before entering hourmeter/checklist on job start. 2-step wizard in StartJobModal

### Fixed  
- **Service Worker cache** — Removed JS/CSS from CacheFirst runtime caching. Root cause: CacheFirst served stale JS chunks after new deploys
- **Currency** — Fixed `$` → `RM` (Malaysian Ringgit) across all inventory views
- **Supabase security** — Enabled RLS on `stocktakes` and `purchase_batches` tables. Set `search_path = public` on all 19 custom plpgsql functions. Hardened 53 RLS policies from `USING(true)` to `USING(auth.uid() IS NOT NULL)`. Restricted 3 overly-broad policies (job_audit_log, van_access_requests, van_audit_log) from all-roles to authenticated-only

---

## [2026-04-06] — Create Job and Reassign Button Fixes

### Fixed
- **External forklift now persists in Create Job flow** — adding a customer asset from "Add External Forklift" now refreshes the forklift dropdown cache, auto-selects the newly created asset immediately, and keeps billing set to chargeable instead of appearing to disappear after clicking Add.
- **External ownership payload hardened** — customer-owned external forklifts now save with both `ownership_type='external'` and customer ownership/customer linkage fields so downstream job creation logic treats them as client assets consistently.
- **Reassign button wiring hardened** — Job Detail reassign actions now use explicit button behavior for both the opener chip and modal actions, avoiding dead clicks from implicit submit/default button behavior.

## Archive

Detailed historical changelogs are available in `docs/archive/`.

## [2026-02-27 v2] — Liquid Inventory Bug Fixes

### Fixed
- **Forklift cost charging** — fluid job usage now records forklift_id + unit_cost_at_time + total_cost in inventory_movements. Cost auto-charged to forklift maintenance record.
- **Van ledger enum labels** — new movement types (van_transfer, job_usage, special_sale) now display correctly instead of blank
- **Admin flagged movements tab** — new "⚠️ Flagged" tab in Van Stock page shows all movements where van balance went negative, for admin review
- **DB trigger** — update_avg_cost_per_liter() now fires automatically on every purchase_batches insert

## [2026-02-27 v3] — Dead Code Cleanup

### Removed
- 17 orphan components never wired into the app (OfflineFormWrapper, PageTransition, SkeletonPatterns, ViewToggle, ServiceAutomationWidget, VanStockWidget, DevPanelToggle, FilterSheet, SwipeableCard, OfflineIndicator, NavigationComponents, NotificationPanel, OfflineSyncStatus, PinJobButton, QuotationPDF, SemanticSearch, TelegramTeamStatus)
- 3 dead services: mockDb.ts (341 lines), syncService.ts (132 lines), storageService.ts (111 lines)
- 3 unused exports from liquidInventoryService.ts: purchaseContainers, breakContainer, adjustStock (replaced by receiveLiquidStock)
- **Total: ~3,100 lines of dead code removed**

## [2026-02-28] — Audit Trail Phase 2

### Added
- **Immutable inventory movements** — DB trigger prevents editing/deleting movement records. Corrections must use reversal entries.
- **Stock Adjustment workflow** — new AdjustStockModal with reason codes (Damage, Theft, Spillage, Counting Error, Expired, Other). All adjustments require admin approval before stock changes.
- **Pending Adjustments tab** — admin approval queue. No self-approval allowed.
- **Stocktake workflow** — new Stocktake tab: admin enters physical count per liquid part, system calculates variance, requires approval from different admin. Approved stocktakes auto-correct stock levels.
- **Batch tracing** — every purchase movement links to its purchase_batch_id. Each batch can have a label and expiry date.
- **Expiry warnings** — amber banner on inventory page when any purchase batch expires within 30 days.
- **Cost variance alert** — ReceiveStockModal warns when new purchase price differs >10% from average.
- **New movement types** — `reversal` and `stocktake` added to inventory_movement_type enum.
- **New DB table** — `stocktakes` (part_id, system_qty, physical_qty, variance, reason, approval workflow).

### Fixed
- **Van stock liquid display** — VanStockDetailModal and TransferItemsModal now show total liters instead of "X sealed + Y.YL loose"
- **Van stock query performance** — getAllVanStocks narrowed to needed columns only (removed `select(*)` wildcards)
- **Ledger labels** — reversal, stocktake, van_transfer, job_usage, special_sale now display proper labels in both warehouse and van ledgers
- **TypeScript types** — InventoryMovement interface updated with purchase_batch_id, reversal_of fields
