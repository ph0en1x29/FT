# Development Workflow

1. **Read first** — Think through the problem, read relevant files before responding. Never speculate about unopened code.

2. **Check in before major changes** — Present the plan, wait for approval.

3. **Explain as you go** — High-level summary after each step.

4. **Keep it simple** — Minimal changes, smallest blast radius. No complex rewrites.

5. **Maintain architecture docs** — Keep documentation current with how the app works.

6. **No hallucination** — If referencing a file, read it first. No claims without investigation.
